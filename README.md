This is the homework from 27.08.2016.

There were a couple of unclear things from the presentation:

1.1 Make sure the first button is using implicit declaration and the other explicit declaration What exactly does this mean? Declaration of the button object or the onClick listener?

2.2 On textView click when item was selected open a new activity and inside of it show component ID and name What do you mean by component name? Is it the text inside the view?
